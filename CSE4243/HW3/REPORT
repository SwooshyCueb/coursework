Initially I was going to use Python 2 for this assignment, as I'm more familiar
with it, and googling nearly anything Python related seems to take me to people
discussing Python 2, more often than not.

I decided, however, to use Python 3 after all, as most installations often come
with the ipaddress module, which I used to validate the ip address strings that
were passed to add_host() and remove_host().

The IP addresses themselves are stored in the variable hostdeny. I included the
function hostfilter_init() to load the configuration. This function need not be
called from outside the module, as if another function cannot find hostdeny, it
calls hostfilter_init(), as this most likely means that the local configuration
has not been loaded.

The configuration itself is handled by pickle. The hostdeny list is pickled and
saved to the user's home directory with the filename ".jam927_hostdeny". Pickle
dumps the list back to the file whenever add_host() or remove_host() is called.

The urllib module was used to make the actual HTTP requests. As was required in
the homework prompt, all exceptions related to the HTTP requests are caught and
more-or-less ignored, simply returning "No page" should an error occur with the
request.

The script I used to test the module is named hw3go.py. It will try to remove a
host that is not on the list, add one that already is, add an IP that is not on
the list, remove said IP, fetch an index from a host that is on the list, fetch
an index that does not exist, fetch one that does, and retrieve the entire list
of denied hosts. It seems to hold up.
